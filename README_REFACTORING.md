./scripts/deploy.sh install   # Base system installation
./scripts/deploy.sh desktop   # Desktop environment 
./scripts/deploy.sh security  # Security hardening

# Help and examples
./scripts/deploy.sh help
```

### Simplified Utilities
```
scripts/
├── deploy.sh              # 🌟 Main unified entry point
├── utils/                 # Single-purpose utilities
│   ├── passwords.sh       # Password management (4 scripts → 1)
│   ├── network.sh         # Network configuration
│   ├── hardware.sh        # Hardware detection/validation
│   ├── validation.sh      # System validation
│   └── profiles.sh        # Profile management
└── internal/              # Shared functions
    └── common.sh          # Common utilities
```

## 🔄 Migration Guide
