# Security Policy and Guidelines

## 🔒 Repository Security

This repository has been designed with **next-generation security practices** including **container security**, **structured audit logging**, and **development environment isolation** to ensure safe public distribution and secure development workflows:

### ✅ What's Secure

- **No hardcoded secrets** - All passwords, keys, and credentials are generated dynamically
- **No SSH keys in repository** - SSH keys are automatically generated during installation
- **No API keys or tokens** - No external service credentials stored
- **No personal information** - Configuration templates use placeholders only
- **Secure defaults** - All configurations follow security best practices
- **🆕 Container isolation** - Development environments are isolated in secure containers
- **🆕 Structured audit logging** - JSON-based security event tracking with correlation IDs
- **🆕 Performance monitoring** - Security-focused deployment monitoring without exposure
- **🆕 Development security** - DevContainers follow security best practices

### 🚫 What's NOT in This Repository

- Private SSH keys
- GitHub deploy keys  
- Personal credentials
- API tokens or secrets
- Hardcoded passwords
- Personal network credentials

## 🔐 SSH Key Management

### Automatic Key Generation

The automation system **automatically generates** SSH keys during installation:

```bash
# ED25519 keys generated automatically with proper permissions
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "user@hostname" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### Key Security Features

- **Unique per installation** - Each system gets fresh, unique keys
- **Strong encryption** - ED25519 keys by default (can be configured)
- **Proper permissions** - Automatic file permission management
- **No passphrase by default** - For automation convenience (can be configured)
- **GitHub ready** - Automatic SSH config for GitHub integration

### Manual Key Management

If you prefer to manage SSH keys manually:

```yaml
# In deployment_config.yml
development:
  ssh_keys:
    generate: false  # Disable automatic generation
```

Then manually configure keys after installation.

## 🐳 **NEW: Container Security**

### Development Container Security

The project implements **container-first security** for safe development:

```bash
# DevContainer security features
.devcontainer/
├── devcontainer.json    # Secure container configuration
├── Dockerfile           # Hardened development image
└── scripts/
    ├── post-create.sh   # Secure environment setup
    └── post-start.sh    # Security validation
```

#### Container Security Features

- **🔒 Isolated Environments**: Complete isolation from host system
- **🛡️ Limited Privileges**: Containers run with minimal required permissions
- **📊 Security Monitoring**: Built-in security monitoring and logging
- **🔐 Secret Management**: Secure handling of development secrets
- **🚫 Network Isolation**: Controlled network access with security profiles

#### Docker Compose Security

```yaml
# Security-focused service configuration
services:
  dev:
    # Security constraints
    cap_drop: [ALL]
    cap_add: [SYS_PTRACE]  # Only for debugging
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
      - seccomp:unconfined
    
    # Resource limits
    mem_limit: 2g
    cpus: 2.0
    
    # Read-only mounts where possible
    volumes:
      - .:/workspace:cached
      - ~/.ssh:/home/developer/.ssh:ro
```

### Structured Security Logging

**🆕 Enhanced audit logging with correlation tracking:**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T20:51:42.123Z",
  "correlation_id": "deploy-abc123",
  "level": "security",
  "event": "ssh_key_generated",
  "user": "developer",
  "details": {
    "key_type": "ed25519",
    "key_location": "/home/developer/.ssh/id_ed25519",
    "permissions": "600"
  }
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Configurations

### Network Security

- **UFW Firewall** - Restrictive defaults, only essential ports open
- **fail2ban** - Intrusion prevention for SSH and other services
- **SSH Hardening** - Disabled root login, key-only authentication

### System Security

- **Full disk encryption** - LUKS encryption for data protection
- **Kernel hardening** - Security-focused kernel parameters
- **Audit logging** - Comprehensive security event logging
- **File permissions** - Proper system file permissions

### Application Security

- **AUR package verification** - Security checks before installation
- **Package integrity** - Checksum verification for all packages
- **Minimal attack surface** - Only essential services enabled

## 🚨 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Send details to: [security email - to be configured]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

## 🔧 Security Best Practices for Users

### Before Installation

- ✅ Verify ISO checksums
- ✅ Use strong encryption passphrases
- ✅ Set strong user passwords
- ✅ Review configuration before deployment

### After Installation

- ✅ Add SSH public key to GitHub: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- ✅ Enable automatic security updates
- ✅ Regularly run security audits: `system-status`
- ✅ Monitor logs: `journalctl -f`
- ✅ Keep system updated: `system-update`

### 🆕 Development Security Practices

#### Container Development Security

- ✅ **Use DevContainers**: Develop in isolated, secure container environments
- ✅ **Validate Dependencies**: All development dependencies are security-scanned
- ✅ **Monitor Performance**: Use built-in monitoring to detect anomalies
- ✅ **Structured Logging**: Enable correlation tracking for security events
- ✅ **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets, use environment variables

#### Development Commands

```bash
# Security-focused development commands
dev-security-scan      # Run security scan on development environment
dev-audit-logs        # Review structured security logs
dev-validate-config   # Validate configuration security
dev-monitor-performance # Monitor for security-relevant performance issues

# Container security validation
docker-compose exec dev security-check
docker-compose logs dev | grep "security"
```

### Configuration Security

```yaml
# Secure configuration example
user:
  password: ""  # Leave empty - will prompt securely

disk:
  encryption:
    enabled: true
    passphrase: ""  # Leave empty - will prompt securely

security:
  firewall:
    enabled: true
  fail2ban:
    enabled: true
  audit:
    enabled: true

automation:
  skip_confirmations: false  # Keep prompts for security
```
