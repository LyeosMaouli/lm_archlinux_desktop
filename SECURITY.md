# Security Policy and Guidelines

## 🔒 Repository Security

This repository has been designed with security best practices to ensure safe public distribution:

### ✅ What's Secure

- **No hardcoded secrets** - All passwords, keys, and credentials are generated dynamically
- **No SSH keys in repository** - SSH keys are automatically generated during installation
- **No API keys or tokens** - No external service credentials stored
- **No personal information** - Configuration templates use placeholders only
- **Secure defaults** - All configurations follow security best practices

### 🚫 What's NOT in This Repository

- Private SSH keys
- GitHub deploy keys  
- Personal credentials
- API tokens or secrets
- Hardcoded passwords
- Personal network credentials

## 🔐 SSH Key Management

### Automatic Key Generation

The automation system **automatically generates** SSH keys during installation:

```bash
# ED25519 keys generated automatically with proper permissions
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "user@hostname" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### Key Security Features

- **Unique per installation** - Each system gets fresh, unique keys
- **Strong encryption** - ED25519 keys by default (can be configured)
- **Proper permissions** - Automatic file permission management
- **No passphrase by default** - For automation convenience (can be configured)
- **GitHub ready** - Automatic SSH config for GitHub integration

### Manual Key Management

If you prefer to manage SSH keys manually:

```yaml
# In deployment_config.yml
development:
  ssh_keys:
    generate: false  # Disable automatic generation
```

Then manually configure keys after installation.

## 🛡️ Security Configurations

### Network Security

- **UFW Firewall** - Restrictive defaults, only essential ports open
- **fail2ban** - Intrusion prevention for SSH and other services
- **SSH Hardening** - Disabled root login, key-only authentication

### System Security

- **Full disk encryption** - LUKS encryption for data protection
- **Kernel hardening** - Security-focused kernel parameters
- **Audit logging** - Comprehensive security event logging
- **File permissions** - Proper system file permissions

### Application Security

- **AUR package verification** - Security checks before installation
- **Package integrity** - Checksum verification for all packages
- **Minimal attack surface** - Only essential services enabled

## 🚨 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Send details to: [security email - to be configured]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

## 🔧 Security Best Practices for Users

### Before Installation

- ✅ Verify ISO checksums
- ✅ Use strong encryption passphrases
- ✅ Set strong user passwords
- ✅ Review configuration before deployment

### After Installation

- ✅ Add SSH public key to GitHub: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- ✅ Enable automatic security updates
- ✅ Regularly run security audits: `system-status`
- ✅ Monitor logs: `journalctl -f`
- ✅ Keep system updated: `system-update`

### Configuration Security

```yaml
# Secure configuration example
user:
  password: ""  # Leave empty - will prompt securely

disk:
  encryption:
    enabled: true
    passphrase: ""  # Leave empty - will prompt securely

security:
  firewall:
    enabled: true
  fail2ban:
    enabled: true
  audit:
    enabled: true

automation:
  skip_confirmations: false  # Keep prompts for security
```

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Configuration file reviewed
- [ ] Strong passwords planned
- [ ] Encryption enabled
- [ ] Network security configured

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] SSH keys added to required services
- [ ] Firewall status verified: `sudo ufw status`
- [ ] fail2ban status checked: `sudo fail2ban-client status`
- [ ] Audit system active: `sudo systemctl status auditd`
- [ ] System health verified: `system-status`

## 🔄 Security Updates

### Automatic Updates

The system can be configured for automatic security updates:

```bash
# Enable automatic security updates
sudo systemctl enable --now unattended-upgrades

# Check update status
system-update --check
```

### Manual Updates

```bash
# System packages
sudo pacman -Syu

# AUR packages
yay -Sua

# Security audit
sudo /usr/local/bin/audit-analysis
```
